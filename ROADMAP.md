# Product Roadmap

Strategic plan to evolve Sapliy into a **production-grade, open-source sapliy automation platform** — combining the reliability of Stripe with the flexibility of Zapier.

---

## Vision

**Event-driven automation & policy platform for fintech and business flows.**

Provide developer-first, scalable infrastructure where:

- Everything is an **event**
- Events trigger **flows**
- Flows execute **actions**
- All within isolated **zones**

---

## Core Mental Model

```
Organization → Zone → Event → Flow → Action
```

| Concept          | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Organization** | Owns everything, has users/teams/policies      |
| **Zone**         | Isolated automation space with test/live modes |
| **Event**        | The universal trigger (SDK, UI, providers)     |
| **Flow**         | Automation logic connecting events to actions  |

---

## Versioned Journey

| Version  | Focus      | Outcome                                      |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **v0.x** | Foundation | Core primitives (payments, ledger, webhooks) |
| **v1.0** | Quality    | Tests, idempotency, clean layering           |
| **v1.x** | Growth     | SDKs, observability, wallets                 |
| **v2.x** | Services   | Hosted version, enterprise support           |
| **v3.x** | DX         | SDK enhancement, performance                 |
| **v4.x** | Ecosystem  | UI components, CLI v2, examples              |
| **v5.x** | Automation | Zone platform, flow engine, policies         |

## Monetization Strategy

| Tier           | Zones     | Events/mo | Price   |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| **Free**       | 1         | 1,000     | $0      |
| **Starter**    | 3         | 10,000    | $29/mo  |
| **Pro**        | Unlimited | 100,000   | $99/mo  |
| **Enterprise** | Custom    | Custom    | Contact |

Revenue drivers:

- Zone count
- Event volume
- Notification credits (WhatsApp, SMS)
- Third-party plugins
- Hosted execution
- SLA guarantees
